# Implementation Plans

This directory contains implementation plans for features, refactoring, upgrades, and other project initiatives.

## Purpose

Implementation plans provide structured guidance for:
- 🚀 **New Features**: Detailed specifications for feature development
- 🔧 **Refactoring**: Code improvement and restructuring plans
- ⬆️ **Upgrades**: Package, dependency, or system upgrade roadmaps
- 🏗️ **Architecture**: System design and architectural decisions
- 📊 **Infrastructure**: DevOps and infrastructure changes
- 🧪 **Testing**: Test coverage and quality improvements

## Plan Structure

All implementation plans follow a standardized template with:

```yaml
---
goal: Brief description of the plan's objective
version: Version number (e.g., 1.0)
date_created: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
owner: Team or individual responsible
status: Planned|In progress|Completed|On Hold|Deprecated
tags: [relevant, tags, for, categorization]
---
```

### Status Indicators

Plans use status badges to indicate current state:

- ![Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue) - Not yet started
- ![In Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-In%20Progress-yellow) - Currently being implemented
- ![Completed](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Completed-brightgreen) - Successfully finished
- ![On Hold](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-On%20Hold-orange) - Temporarily paused
- ![Deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Deprecated-red) - No longer relevant

## Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern: `[purpose]-[component]-[version].md`

**Purpose Prefixes:**
- `feature-` - New feature implementation
- `refactor-` - Code refactoring
- `upgrade-` - Package or system upgrade
- `architecture-` - Architectural decision or design
- `infrastructure-` - Infrastructure changes
- `data-` - Data migration or transformation
- `process-` - Process improvement
- `design-` - Design system or UI/UX changes

**Examples:**
- `feature-auth-module-1.md`
- `upgrade-pytest-coverage-1.md`
- `refactor-cli-commands-2.md`
- `architecture-microservices-1.md`

## Creating New Plans

Use the GitHub Copilot prompt to generate plans:

```
/create-implementation-plan
```

Or manually use the template from: `.github/prompts/create-implementation-plan.prompt.md`

## Current Plans

| Plan | Status | Purpose | Version |
|------|--------|---------|---------|
| [test-coverage-improvement-v1.md](test-coverage-improvement-v1.md) | ![Planned](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-Planned-blue) | Increase unit test coverage to >80% | 1.0 |

## Guidelines

1. **Keep plans focused** - One plan per major initiative
2. **Be specific** - Include file paths, function names, exact requirements
3. **Make it executable** - Tasks should be actionable without clarification
4. **Track progress** - Update status and completion dates regularly
5. **Document alternatives** - Explain why certain approaches were chosen
6. **Define success** - Include clear completion criteria
